A task in "Skriptspråk i webmiljö", a course in Gävle University College.
A database of music records. Any one can add new records and also get a list of all the records existing in the database.

In order for this to work the files should be located on the web server, since PHP files first need to be processed in a web server before sending their output to the web browser.
